Reading through/ working through Cracking the Coding Interview by Gayle McDowell

## Big O Notation:

	O(s) - the time is linear to that of the size of the file
	O(1) - time is constant regardless of size
	

	-- Quicksort
		Best case O(N) - all elements are equal then each element once
		Worst case O(N^2) - Pivot is biggest element
		Expected case O(n log n) - random pivot number
	### Space Complexity
		The amount of memory you create during the program

	--Runtime of recursive functions with multiple branches
		O(branches^depth)


	--O(log n) number of times we can halve n until 1

## Technical Questions

	-- Data Structures
		Linked Lists
		Trees, Tries, Graphs
		Stacks & Queues
		Heaps
		Vectors/ ArrayLists
		Hash Tables
	-- Algorithms
		Breadth-First Search
		Depth-First Search
		Binary Search
		Merge Sort
		Quick Sort
	-- Concepts
		Bit Manipulation
		Memory (Stack vs Heap)
		Recursion
		Dynamic Programming
		Big O Time & Space

	Look for BUD
		B - Bottlenecks
		U - Unnecessary Work
		D - Duplicated Work
